- SleepScore/Visbrain Basics
    - Loading Data into Sleepscore
        - First activate sleepscoring conda environment
        - Then run: python -m sleepscore "path-to-config-file"
    - GUI Set-Up
        - Total window length: 24sec.
        - Epoch length: 4 sec.
        - Step Size = Total window length
        - Spectrogram based on parietal EEG if possible (typically cleaner Theta), but frontal also works - quality of signal is more important
- Decison-Making Principles
    - Data Types
        - The EMG is very helpful... if the EMG is active, the animal is very likely NOT asleep
        - EEG is the best signal to use for sleepscoring. In any ambiguous situation, the EEG wins.
    - Arousals During NREM
        - IF arousal length clearly <1 sec, do not score out, ignore and count as NREM.
        - IF arousal length clearly between 1 and 4 sec, score it out as Brief Awakening
        - IF arousal length clearly > 4 sec (i.e. larger than a single 4-sec epoch) scored as Wake.
    - Possible Transitions
        - W —> NREM
            - Transition to NREM button = 2
        - NREM —> REM
            - Transition to REM button = 3
        - REM —> W
            - Transition-to-wake button = 7
        - NREM —> W
        - Very occasionally you can also get wake directly to REM, but this always is something like REM, brief period of wake, then back into REM. Never a long period of wake straight into REM without first having NREM.
